# Perfumy CSS Learning Project

Welcome to the Perfumy CSS Learning Project! This repository contains the materials for learning and practicing CSS concepts. The project is divided into two main folders:

1. `Perfumy-starter-project`: This folder contains the starting point of the project, which includes the basic HTML structure for a perfume-themed website. Here, you will gradually enhance the styling using CSS concepts.

2. `Perfumy-final-project`: In this folder, you will find the completed version of the project where all the CSS concepts have been applied to create a visually appealing and responsive website.
